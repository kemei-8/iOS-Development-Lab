/*:
 ## App Exercise - Fitness Tracker: Constant or Variable?
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 There are all sorts of things that a fitness tracking app needs to keep track of in order to display the right information to the user. Similar to the last exercise, declare either a constant or a variable for each of the following items, and assign each a sensible value. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.
 
 - Name: The user's name
 - Age: The user's age
 - Number of steps taken today: The number of steps that a user has taken today
 - Goal number of steps: The user's goal for number of steps to take each day
 - Average heart rate: The user's average heart rate over the last 24 hours
 */
let userName = "Chase"
print("Constant b/c name doesn't change")
var userAge = 6
print("Var b/c age changes as time passes")
var userSteps = 2000
print("Var b/c steps can increase throughout day")
let goalSteps = 5000
print("Constant b/c goal should not change")
var userHeartRate = 110
print("Var b/c heart rate varies throughout day")

/*:
 Now go back and add a line after each constant or variable declaration. On those lines, print a statement explaining why you chose to declare the piece of information as a constant or variable.
